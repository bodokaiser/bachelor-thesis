\addchap{Acknowledgement}

The success and final outcome of the present work required a lot of guidance
and assistance from many people, without them it would not have been possible
for me to deliver this piece of work and look back on to the exciting,
enriching and diverse experience made in the last weeks, and I would not
forget to thank them.

At most I want to thank my parents for their support, that I have been
privileged to benefit from all the years. Though my life involved many
unexpected turnarounds, I never felt left alone and could rely on your
diverse experience.

Further I want to thank Prof. Bloch and Dr. Aidelsburger for creating and
sustaining a fertile scientific environment that allows inspiring discussions
at almost any time as well as seamless implementation of new ideas. Equally I
want to express my gratitude to all personal involved in the formation process
of my thesis. Especially I want to name Christian Schweizer, Hendrik v. Raven
and Till Klostermann who were available for any questions but also open to
fun from time to time. Finally I want to thank Bodo Hecker for any electronic
specific advise.

I also owe my deep gratitude to XY, who have been so friendly to check this
thesis against all sort of language abuses and offer a wide range of
suggestions to improve the expressiveness.
