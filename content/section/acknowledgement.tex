\addchap{Acknowledgement}

The success and final outcome of the present work required a lot of guidance
and assistance from many people. Without them tt would not have been possible
for me to deliver this work and remember the exciting time I had in the past
weeks.

At most I want to thank my parents for their support, that I have been
privileged to benefit from all the years. Though my life involved many
unexpected turnarounds, I never felt left alone and could rely on your
diverse experience whenever the situation required it.

Further I want to thank Prof. Immanuel Bloch and Dr. Monika Aidelsburger for
creating and sustaining a fertile scientific environment for inspiring
discussions at almost any time as well as the seamless implementation of new
ideas.
Equally I want to express my gratitude to all personal involved in the
formation process of my thesis. Especially I want to name Christian Schweizer
who had seen everything before, Hendrik v. Raven in particular for his help
with the electronic setup and Till Klostermann for his help with the optical
setup and measurement conclusions I would have never thought about by myself.
Finally I want to thank Bodo Hecker for his advice as electrical engineer and
distinct perspective on undergone challenges.
