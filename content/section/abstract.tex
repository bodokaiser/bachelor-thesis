  Ultracold atoms in optical lattices open up a wide range of possibilities
  to simulate quantum effects which would elsewise be neither computational
  nor experimentally tangible.

  The topology of the optical lattice is a decisive parameter of these kind
  of experiments and therefore of major interest. Recently, efforts have been
  reported to support novel potential dynamics through the use of micromirror
  arrays that permit alterations of localized potentials. Though promising
  results have been achieved, limitations due to the mechanical nature of
  these mirror arrays are well-known.

  In the present work we present an alternative low-cost implementation based
  on acousto-optic deflectors and direct digital synthesizers. We will find
  that though this approach proves to be in general feasible, practical
  application places requirements on the electronic signal source not met by
  the direct digital synthesizers. The encountered challenges and conclusions
  drawn however, are of considerable importance for a foreseen design
  fullfilling the disclosed demands.
