\chapter{Characterisation of the optical setup}\label{ch:optical_setup}

In this short chapter we want to characterize the optical setup introduced in
\Cref{ch:experimental_setup}. In particular we want to estimate the
performance of the intensity feedback loop and the quality of our alignment
by comparing the beam profile with the results reported in
Ref.~\cite{Hertlein2017}.

\section{Intensity control}

In \Cref{ch:experimental_setup} we stated that the laser intensity is
regulated by a control loop using an \gls{aom} in the power reduction setup.
Without the additional intensity regulation we would
observe various intensity drifts from the laser source throughout the
measurements as depicted in \Cref{fig:intensity_uncontrolled} where we can
observe short- and long-term oscillations over a large intensity range.

  \caption{Time evolution of the uncontrolled laser intensity.
  }\label{fig:intensity_uncontrolled}
\end{figure}
The setup used to record the intensity evolutions is disclosed in
\Cref{fig:intensity_control_setup}. It differs from the optical setup
described in \Cref{ch:experimental_setup} by the absence of the \gls{aod}
and the relocation of Photodiode \num{2} at the end of the laser beam. The
photodiode gain of Photodiode \num{2} was lowered from \SI{70}{\decibel} to
\SI{50}{\decibel} because the lack of \gls{aod}s would otherwise cause the
photodiode to saturate due to higher intensities.

  \caption{Optical setup and intensity detection. The beam hits Photodiode 2
    which is connected to the oscilloscope.
  }\label{fig:intensity_control_setup}
\end{figure}
In order to to estimate the error contribution due to imperfect intensity
regulation, we will conduct a short- and a long-term measurement of the
stabilized intensity. Technically a typical photodiode measurement takes about
a fraction of a millisecond, yet we can decide on different intervals between
the measurements in order to separate short-term from long-term trends like
the ones noted in the uncontrolled meausrement.
\Cref{tab:intensity_control_times} summarizes the different time scales for
the conducted short- and long-term measurement of the intensity control.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    & Short & Long & \gls{aod} \\
    \midrule
    Interval &
    \SI{10}{\second} &
    \SI{120}{\second} &
    \SI{3}{\second} \\
    Duration &
    \SI{1}{\hour} &
    \SI{16}{\hour} &
    \SI{<2}{\hour} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Interval and duration times of the short- and long-term measurement
    as well as a typical \gls{aod} frequency sweep measurement.
  }\label{tab:intensity_control_times}
\end{table}
The voltage time series for both intensity control measurements are presented
in \Cref{fig:intensity_control}. The outlier at about 22:45 h was caused by
accidently interfering with the setup during measurement. Beside of that
incident the long-term intensity seems stable. On a smaller timescale we see
that the intensity evolution performs periodic oscillations.

    short- and long-term intensity evolutions as well as a typical \gls{aod}
    frequency sweep measurement for comparison.
  }\label{tab:intensity_control_statistics}
\end{table}
Overall we can confirm that the intensity control loop successfully holds the
intensity mean, though with small oscillations. In order to estimate the
relevance of these small oscillations of the controlled intensity for later
measurements, we performed a measurement of the intensity variations introduced
by the \gls{aod} subject to constant frequency increments for comparison.
\Cref{tab:intensity_control_statistics} presents the statistics of said
intensity measurements.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/intensity/control/long-short.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Long- and short-term measurement of the controlled intensity at
    different voltage scales.
  }\label{fig:intensity_control}
\end{figure}
We should note that not all of the statistical measurements are directly
comparable because of the \SI{20}{\decibel} higher photodiode gain used in
the \gls{aod} frequency sweep measurement. Nevertheless we can directly compare
the uncontrolled and the controlled short- and long-term measurements
directly. As we divide by the mean $\mu$, the relative standard deviation
$\sigma/\mu$ is a scale invariant statistical measure and thereby comparable
through measurements conducted with different photodiode gain setting.
Comparing the relative standard deviation yields that the intensity drifts
are small on a short time scale compared to intensity variations in a typcial
measurement. In order to compare the intensity deviations further we calculate
the \gls{rmd} via
\begin{equation}
  I_\text{rmd}
  =
  \frac{I-\overline{I}}{\overline{I}}
  \label{eq:relative_mean_deviation},
\end{equation}
where $\overline{I}$ denotes the intensity mean. In
\Cref{fig:intensity_control_rmd} the \gls{rmd} of the not-stabilized and
the actively stabilized measurements are presented as boxplots.

    short-term measurement as well an actively stabilized \gls{aod}
    intensity measurement.
  }\label{fig:intensity_control_rmd}
\end{figure}
Boxplots are heavily based on the concept of \gls{iqr}. The \gls{iqr} is a
scale invariant measure of statistical dispersion and is defined as the
inverse of the \gls{cdf}. The start and end of the boxes inside a boxplot
denote the lower (first) quantile $Q_1$ and the upper (third) quantile $Q_3$
of the \gls{iqr}. Expressed through the \gls{cdf} these read
\begin{align}
  Q_1=\text{CDF}^{-1}{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)} &&
  Q_3=\text{CDF}^{-1}{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}.
\end{align}
Alternatively one can define $Q_1$ as the median of the $n$ smallest entries
and $Q_3$ as the median of the $n$ largest entries where the total dataset
consists out of $2n$ entries for the even and $2n+1$ entries for the odd case.
The whiskers below and atop of the boxes are at $Q_1\pm1.5\text{IQR}$. Values
outside this range are usually considered outliers and marked as circles. The
median is denoted with an orange line. The left boxplot confirms that the
oscillations of the controlled intensity are negligible for typical intensity
measurements. Further the right boxplot confirms that the intensity control
oscillations cover a much smaller range as the uncontrolled oscillations.

\section{Beam profile}

Independently of the error introduced by the imperfect intensity control,
errors can originate from unideal optical alignment. One way to assess the
quality of our alignment is to evaluate the spatial profile of the laser beam
as registered with the \gls{ccd} camera.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../media/setup/intensity-profile.pdf}
  \caption{The beam is focused onto the \gls{ccd} sensor of the camera.
  }\label{fig:intensity_profile_setup}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:intensity_profile_setup} we present the setup used to measure
the spatial beam profile. In comparison to the previous setup we replaced
Photodiode 2 with a \gls{ccd} camera. The \gls{aod}s are configured at a
center frequency of \SI{100}{\mega\hertz}. The distance between Lens 4 and
the \gls{ccd} sensor is chosen such that the laser beam is focused onto the
\gls{ccd} sensor of the camera.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \inputpgf{../figure/intensity/profile}{image.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Image of the focused laser beam measured with the \gls{ccd} camera.
  }\label{fig:intensity_spatial_image}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:intensity_spatial_image} shows an enlarged image patch of the
complete image capture taken with the \gls{ccd} camera. We can see a strong
illuminated circular spot in the center of the image with an area of about
\SI{2.5}{\milli\meter}. The intensity inside the spot seems homogeneous,
however this is caused by a saturation of the pixels in this area. We could
reduce the intensity or apply an optical filter to the camera to resolve the
intensity gradient inside the spot, but only at the cost of the intensity
distribution around the spot. Around the circular spot we can see a
diffraction ring. The diffraction ring is well described
in~\cite{Hertlein2017} and originates from the finite aperture of the
objectives.

  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/intensity/profile/profile.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{One dimensional perpendicular cut of the two dimensional intensity
    distribution from the two dimensional beam profile in
    \Cref{fig:intensity_spatial_image} with fitted gaussian curve.
  }\label{fig:intensity_spatial_profile}
\end{figure}
For better comparison of the radial symmetry we performed two perpendicular
cuts and visualized the one dimensional spatial beam distribution in
\Cref{fig:intensity_spatial_profile}.
In \Cref{fig:intensity_spatial_profile} we can clearly observe the effects of
saturation around the center. The Gaussian fit illustrated how we would expect
the intensity to be if we could experimentally resolve it. In contrast to the
ideal Gaussian profile we again observe contributions in the wings due to the
Airy disc causes by the finite aperture of the objectives in the optical setup,
see \Cref{fig:setup_beam_deflection}. Further we can clearly observe
an assymmetry in the intensity distributions in the wings which means that
our alignment is not perfect. Using
\begin{equation}
  \text{FWHM}=2\sqrt{2\ln2}\sigma
  \label{eq:fwhm_sigma},
\end{equation}
we can find the \gls{fhmw} from the Gaussian fit, being
\SI{0.89}{\micro\meter} for the horizontal and \SI{1.02}{\micro\meter} for
the vertical axis of the beam in the atomic plane.

We can confirm the results reported in~\cite{Hertlein2017} that the spatial
beam profile equals a two dimensional Airy disk caused by the finite
aperture of the objectives. Further we observe slight assymmetries in the
diffraction ring suggesting inperfect alignment. Though asymetries in the
spatial beam profile are present, we do not see any further complications as
the intensity measurements with the photodiode will cover the complete beam
profile.
