\chapter{Characteristic energy scales}\label{ch:energy_scales}

\textit{In the previous chapter we focused on the effective potential obtained
by the superposition of the averaged superposition of the perturbation
potential and the lattice potential. In this chapter we want to understand the
characteristic energy scales in an optical lattice in order to infer the
scanning timescales needed for the generation of a time-averaged optical
potential the physics that determine the time scale of the perturbation
potential.}

\section{Harmonic approximation}

Given the optical lattice potential \cref{eq:potential_lattice} the
lattice Hamiltonian reads
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_\text{lat}
  =\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m}+\hat{V}_\text{lat}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_lattice}.
\end{equation}
One first naive approach to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation
subject to the effective lattice Hamiltonian would be to Taylor expand
the lattice potential up to second order in $kx$
\begin{equation}
  V_\text{lat}(x)
  =V_0\cos^2(kx)
  \approx V_0\left(1-\frac{1}{2}(kx)^2\right)
  \label{eq:potential_harmonic_approximation}.
\end{equation}
With \cref{eq:potential_harmonic_approximation} we get the Hamiltonian of a
linear harmonic quantum oscillator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_\text{har}-V_0
  =\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m}-\frac{1}{2}V_0k^2\hat{x}^2
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_harmonic_approximation},
\end{equation}
with the well-known energy levels
\begin{equation}
  E_n=\hbar\omega(2n+1)/2
  \qc
  \omega=\sqrt{\abs{V_0}/m}k=\sqrt{2\abs{V_0}E_r}/\hbar
  \label{eq:energy_harmonic_approximation},
\end{equation}
where we introduced the recoil energy $E_r=(\hbar k)^2/(2m)$ as an
atom-independent energy scale. In natural scales of the quantum harmonic
oscillator we find the time-independent wave functions for the energy level
$n$ to be
\begin{equation}
  \psi_n(x)
  =
  \bra{x}\ket{\psi}
  =
  \frac{\exp(-\frac{1}{2}x^2)}{\sqrt{2^nn!}\pi^{1/4}}H_n(x)
  \label{eq:wavefunction_harmonic},
\end{equation}
where $H_n(x)$ is the $n$th Hermite polynomial and the spatial coordinate $x$
is expessed in natural length units of $xi=(2E_r/\abs{V_0})^{1/4}/k$.

  \caption{Probability density of the wave functions of the harmonic
    approximation of the lattice potential.
  }\label{fig:scale_harmonic}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:scale_harmonic} we have visualized the probability densities of
the wave functions of the harmonic approximation for the lattice depth
$V_0=-30E_r$ up to the fourth energy level. The probablity density decays
exponentially at the potential boundary and thereby the probability for a
particle to tunnel through the lattice potential vanishes. It turns out that
the harmonic approximation is not suited for usual lattice depths of below
$V_0=-30E_r$ as we will after comparing the energy levels of the harmonic
approximation with the exact energies. Nevertheless the harmonic approximation
gives a correct magnitude of the energy while being soft on complexity.

\section{Lattice structures}

The periodicity of the lattice potential \cref{eq:potential_lattice}
suggests that there exists a finite representation in the frequency domain.
In the context of lattice structures the frequency domain is commonly known
as the reciprocal lattice. We will shortly recapitulate the lattice structure
basics from Ref.~\cite{Roessler2004}. Let
\begin{equation}
  \vb{R}
  =\bra{\vb{x}}\ket{\vb{R}}
  =\sum_{i=1}^Nn_i\vb{a}_i
  \qc n_1,\dots,n_N\in\mathbb{Z},
\end{equation}
be an element of the Bravais lattice, i.e.\ a member of the lattice in the
spatial domain, with $\vb{a}_i$ being the primitive vectors that span the
primitive lattice cell. Then the reciprocal lattice is defined as the discrete
point set
\begin{equation}
  \vb{G}
  =\bra{\vb{p}}\ket{\vb{G}}
  =\sum_{i=1}^Nm_i\vb{b}_i
  \qc m_1,\dots,m_N\in\mathbb{Z},
\end{equation}
that satisfy the condition $\exp(\vb{R}\cdot\vb{G})=1$, with $\vb{b}_i$ being
the reciprocal primitive lattice vector. For a simple cubic lattice structure
the reciprocal primitive lattice vector relates to the primitive vector by
\begin{equation}
  \vb{b}_i
  =2\pi\vb{a}_i/{{\vb{a}_i}^2}.
\end{equation}
For the subsequent sections we will only consider the one dimensional simple
cubic lattice. Cubic lattices of higher dimension, however, can be easily
obtained by superposition of the potentials. We now take $\ket{G_u}$ to be
the $u$th reciprocal lattice point. An arbitrary operator $\hat{A}$ with
known representation in the spatial domain can be expressed in the recoprocal
lattice basis through the transformation
\begin{equation}
  \bra{G_u}\hat{A}\ket{G_v}
  =\int\dd{x}\bra{G_u}\ket{x}^*\bra{x}\hat{A}\ket{x}\bra{G_v}\ket{x}
  =\int\dd{x}A(x)e^{2ikx(u-v)}
  \label{eq:operator_in_reciprocal_lattice}.
\end{equation}
Evaluation of \cref{eq:operator_in_reciprocal_lattice} for the specific
lattice potential found in \cref{eq:potential_lattice} yields
\begin{equation}
  \bra{G_u}\hat{V}_\text{lat}\ket{G_v}
  =\frac{1}{4}V_0\left(2\delta^u_v+\delta^u_{v-1}+\delta^s_{u+v}\right)
  \label{eq:potential_in_reciprocal_lattice},
\end{equation}
which we will later use as matrix elements.

\section{Bloch states}

While \cref{eq:potential_in_reciprocal_lattice} gives us a simple representation
of the periodic lattice potential we are missing an Ansatz for the wave
function to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation. Fortunately
Bloch's theorem states that for a periodic potential
\begin{equation}
  V_\text{per}(x+a)=V_\text{per}(x)
  \label{eq:potential_periodic},
\end{equation}
there exists a complete set of wave functions that are energy eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_\text{per}
  =\frac{\hat{\vb{p}}^2}{2m}+\hat{V}_\text{per}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_periodic},
\end{equation}
and each of these Bloch waves can be written into the form
\begin{equation}
  \bra{x}\ket{\Psi^n_q}
  =\Psi^n_q(x)
  =e^{iqx}\psi^n_q(x)
  \label{eq:state_bloch},
\end{equation}
with $\psi^n_q(x+a)=\psi^n_q(x)$, wave vector $q$ and bandindex $n$. We
confine the wave number to the first Brillouin zone $\left[-k,+k\right[$,
also known as the primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice,
\begin{equation}
  q=\frac{ks}{N}
  \qc s\in\left[-N,N-1\right]\cap\mathbb{Z}
  \label{eq:wavenumber_quasi},
\end{equation}
with $N$ being the number of lattice sites. The discretization arises from
the Born-von Karman boundary condition. For a complete proof of Bloch's
theorem as well as details on the Born-von Karman boundary condition we refer
the reader to Ref.~\cite{Roessler2004} and Ref.~\cite{Bartelmann2018}.

\section{Energy band structure}

Using the Bloch states \cref{eq:state_bloch} as ansatz to solve
\cref{eq:hamiltonian_lattice} and noting that by the product rule
$\hat{p}^2\Psi^n_q(x)=e^{iqx}(\hat{p}+\hbar q)\psi^n_q(x)$, we find
\begin{equation}
  E^n_q\ket{\Psi^n_{q}}
  =\hat{H}_{lat}\ket{\Psi^n_{q}}
  =e^{iqx}\left(\frac{(\hat{p}+\hbar q)^2}{2m}+\hat{V}_\text{lat}\right)\ket{\psi^n_{q}}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_energy_lattice}.
\end{equation}
Expansion of the state $\psi^n_q$ in states of the reciprocal lattice returns
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi^n_q}
  =\left(\sum_u\ket{G_u}\bra{G_u}\right)\ket{\psi^n_q}
  =\sum_u \braket{G_u}{\psi^n_q}\ket{G_u}
  =\sum_u c^n_{uq}\ket{G_u}
  \label{eq:state_bloch_in_reciprocal_lattice},
\end{equation}
where the summation over $u$ is restricted to the number of reciprocal
lattice sites one wants to consider for numeric evaluation, or the set of
integer numbers in general. The momentum eigenvalues of the state $\ket{G_u}$
can be found by expansion into position space
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}\ket{G_s}
  =\int\int\dd{x}\dd{y}\ket{y}\bra{y}\hat{p}\ket{x}\bra{x}\ket{G_s}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_momentum_reciprocal_lattice1}.
\end{equation}
With $\bra{y}\hat{p}\ket{x}=-i\hbar\delta(y-x)\dv{x}$ we can take the
derivative of $\bra{x}\ket{G_s}=e^{2ikxu}$ and simplify
\cref{eq:eigenvalue_momentum_reciprocal_lattice1} down to
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}\ket{G_u}
  =2\hbar ku\int\dd{x}\ket{x}\bra{x}\ket{G_u}
  =2\hbar ku\ket{G_u}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_momentum_reciprocal_lattice2}.
\end{equation}
Finally we insert \cref{eq:state_bloch_in_reciprocal_lattice} into
\cref{eq:eigenvalue_energy_lattice} and apply $\bra{G_v}$ to the
right hand side while using \cref{eq:potential_in_reciprocal_lattice} and
\cref{eq:eigenvalue_momentum_reciprocal_lattice2}, yielding
\begin{equation}
  E^n_qc^n_{vq}
  =c^n_{vq}
  \frac{(2u+q/k)^2}{2m}E_r+
  \sum_u c^n_{uq}\bra{G_v}\hat{V}_\text{lat}\ket{G_u}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_energy_lattice_explicit},
\end{equation}
with recoil energy $E_r=\hbar^2k^2/(2m)$. Using
\cref{eq:potential_in_reciprocal_lattice} we finally find the matrix elements
of the lattice Hamiltonian \cref{eq:hamiltonian_lattice} to be
\begin{equation}
  H_{uv}
  =\bra{G_u}\hat{H}_\text{lat}\ket{G_v}
  =\begin{cases}
    (2u+q/k)^2E_r+\frac{1}{2}V_0, & \text{if }u=v\\
    \frac{1}{4}V_0, & \text{if } \abs{u-v}=1\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_lattice_elements}.
\end{equation}
By choosing a sufficient large matrix dimension, setting its values according
to \cref{eq:hamiltonian_lattice_elements} and finding its eigenvalues, we
are able to reproduce the energy band structure.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Parameters used for the lattice Hamiltonian matrix elements to
    calculate the energy bands.
  }\label{tab:hamiltonian_elements}
\end{table}
\Cref{tab:hamiltonian_elements} lists the parameters we choose to calculate
the energy bands for the lattice Hamiltonian matrix elements defined in
\cref{eq:hamiltonian_lattice_elements}.

  \caption{Energy band structure for $N=51$ lattice sites and various lattice
    potential depths $V_0$.
  }\label{fig:scale_energy_structure}
\end{figure}
The energy band structure for these parameters is depicted in
\Cref{fig:scale_energy_structure} for various lattice depths. For $V_0=0$ we
can see how the confinement to the first Brillouin zone causes the energy band
to be reflective at the boundaries of the Brillouin zone. Further we see that
with increasing lattice depth the energy spacing increases.

  \caption{Minimum and maximum energy range for the first four energy bands
    with the energy levels derived from the harmonic approximation.
  }\label{fig:scale_energy}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:scale_energy} we plotted the minimum and maximum energy range
for the first four energy bands with increasing lattice depth next to the
energy levels of the harmonic approximation. We can see how with increasing
lattice depth the energy bands narrow to discrete energy levels as predicted
with the harmonic approximation \cref{eq:energy_harmonic_approximation}.

Beside of the energy levels, we know that quantum particles have a non-zero
probability amplitude to tunnel through classically forbidden potentials. In
our context these quantum tunneling effects are described by the hopping term
--- an energy which corresponds to the mobility of the atoms in the lattice.

\section{Wannier states}

So far we studied the effects of a periodic lattice potential on the energy
levels and the Bloch wave functions that are extended over the full lattice.
As lattice hopping is a local effect it makes sense to use a more localized
basis like the Wannier basis.

The most common definition of the Wannier function with bandindex $n$ on
lattice site $l$ reads
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\phi^n_{l}}
  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_qe^{-iqla}\ket{\Psi^n_{q}}
  \label{eq:state_wannier_orthodox},
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\Psi^n_q}$ is the Bloch wave function defined in
\cref{eq:state_bloch}. The defintion in \cref{eq:state_wannier_orthodox} is
valid for simple lattice structures, however for more sophisticated lattices
the Gauge degree of freedom of the phase of the Bloch states leads to
different Wannier states, whereof only one is the maximally localized
one~\cite{Goerg2014}. One can find the phase of the Bloch states by minimizing
the spread of the Wannier functions defined in
\cref{eq:state_wannier_orthodox}, however there exists an alternative
definition that resolves the phase ubiquity. According to this definition the
Wannier states are best to construct as the eigenstates of the band projected
position operator. The band projector for a band $n$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{P}_n
  =\sum_q\ket{\Psi^n_q}\bra{\Psi^n_q}
  \label{eq:operator_band_projector},
\end{equation}
and the band projected position operator just follows as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{x}_n
  =\hat{P}_n\hat{x}_n\hat{P}_n
  \label{eq:operator_band_projected_position}.
\end{equation}
The Wannier states are now defined as the eigenstates of the eigenvalue
equation
\begin{equation}
  \hat{x}_n\ket{\phi^n_l}=x^n_l\ket{\phi^n_l}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_band_projected_position},
\end{equation}
where $x^n_l$ is the $l$th lattice site in the $n$th energy band. Choosing
the Bloch functions to find the elements of the band projected position
operator \cref{eq:operator_band_projected_position} through
\begin{equation}
  X^{nn^\prime}_{qq^\prime}
  =\bra{\Psi^n_q}\hat{x}_n\ket{\Psi^{n^\prime}_{q^\prime}}
  =\int_0^{Na}\dd{x}\Psi^n_q(x)^*x\Psi^{n^\prime}_{q^\prime}(x)
  \label{eq:element_band_projected_position},
\end{equation}
provides an analytical expression to calculate the matrix elements
\cite{Bissbort2013}. Let $d^{mn}_{lq}$ be the diagonalized
matrix $X^{nn^\prime}_{qq^\prime}$ in
\cref{eq:element_band_projected_position} then the Wannier states are fully
determined by
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\phi^n_l}
  =\sum_{n,q}d^{mn}_{lq}\ket{\Phi^n_q}
  \label{eq:state_wannier}.
\end{equation}

\section{Hopping energy}

With the previous tools in place we are now set to give an expression for the
tunneling matrix element between neighboring lattice sites. We define the
hopping from lattice site $l$ to lattice site $l^\prime$ for bandindex $n$ as
\begin{equation}
  J^n_{l-l^\prime}
  =-\bra{\phi^n_l}\hat{H}_\text{lat}\ket{\phi^n_{l^\prime}}
  \label{eq:element_hopping}.
\end{equation}
Using the common definition of the Wannier states
\cref{eq:state_wannier_orthodox} for \cref{eq:element_hopping} we find
\begin{equation}
  J^n_{l-l^\prime}
  =-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{q,q^\prime}e^{iqa(l-l^\prime)}
  \bra{\Psi^n_q}\hat{H}_\text{lat}\ket{\Psi^n_{q^\prime}}
  \label{eq:element_hopping2}.
\end{equation}
The Bloch states are energy eigenstates
\cref{eq:eigenvalue_energy_lattice_explicit} and orthonormal, henceforth
\begin{equation}
  J^n_{l-l^\prime}
  =-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{q}E^n_qe^{iqa(l-l^\prime)}
  \label{eq:element_hopping3},
\end{equation}
where the sum covers all allowed $q$ as defined in \cref{eq:wavenumber_quasi}.
Expression \cref{eq:element_hopping3} is exact for a given number of lattice
sites $N$ and can be evaluated numerically. The form of
\cref{eq:element_hopping3} resembles a discrete Fourier transform. The
inverse Fourier transform gives us the energies in terms of the hopping
probabilites
\begin{equation}
  E^n_q
  =\sum_{l-l^\prime}J^n_{l-l^\prime}e^{-iqa(l-l^\prime)}
  \label{eq:element_energy_hopping},
\end{equation}
where the sum runs from $l-l^\prime=-N$ to $l-l^\prime=+N$.

\subsection{Nearest-neighbor approximation}

For deep potentials $V_0\gtrapprox-3E_r$ hopping only contributes from direct
neighbour sites~\cite{Rom2009}, thus we can abort the sum in
\cref{eq:element_energy_hopping} for $\abs{l-l^\prime}>1$
\begin{equation}
  E^n_q
  \approx J^n_{l+1-l}e^{-iqa}+J^n_{l-1-l}e^{+iqa}+J^n_{l-l}
  =J^n_0+2J^n_1\cos(qa)
  \label{eq:hopping_nn},
\end{equation}
where we have used $J^n_{-1}=J^n_{+1}=J_1$ because of translation invariance.
Evaluation of $J^n_0$ using \cref{eq:element_hopping} tells us that $J^n_0$
just is the average energy of an energy band. Evaluation of
\cref{eq:hopping_nn} at $q=0$ and $q=k$ and subtracting the results from
eachother yields us the tight-binding approximation
\begin{equation}
  J^n_1\approx\frac{1}{4}\left(E^n_k-E^n_0\right)
  \label{eq:hopping_nn_tight},
\end{equation}
which assumes a $\cos(qa)$ shaped energy band. Further~\cite{Bloch2008}
reports an analytical proxmity
\begin{equation}
  J^n_1\approx
  \frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{V_0}{E_r}\right)^{3/4}\exp(-2\sqrt{V_0/E_r})
  \label{eq:hopping_nn_proximity},
\end{equation}
to be valid for sinusoidal potentials like \cref{eq:potential_lattice} and
to be derived from the Mathieu equation. The Mathieu equation can be obtained
from the time-independent Schrödinger equation with
$V_0\cos^2(kx)=\frac{1}{2}V_0\left(1-\cos(2kx)\right)$.
In Ref.~\cite{Connor1984} we found a more elaborate deviation of
\cref{eq:hopping_nn_proximity}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/scale/hopping-nn.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Nearest-neighbor hopping energy derived from the exact numerical
    calculations, the tight-binding approximation and an analytical proxmity
    \cref{eq:hopping_nn_proximity}.
  }\label{fig:scale_hopping_nn}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:scale_hopping_nn} compares the exact numerical calculations using
\cref{eq:element_hopping3} for $l-l^\prime=1$, the tight-binding approximation
defined in \cref{eq:hopping_nn_tight} and an analytical approximation
\cref{eq:hopping_nn_proximity}. We note that the tight-binding approximation
and the exact calculations converge already for small lattice depths for the
first energy band and for medium lattice depths for the second energy band.
For the third and higher energy bands the numerical evaluation should be used.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/scale/hopping.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Hopping energies for different neighbour ranges.
  }\label{fig:scale_hopping}
\end{figure}
From now on we will use the exact numerical calculation of the hopping energy.
In \Cref{fig:scale_hopping} we calculated the hopping terms using
\cref{eq:element_hopping3} for different $l-l^\prime$ as well as a sum over
all $l-l^\prime$. We can see that the nearest-neighbor term $J^n_1$ is most
dominant, and, except for the second energy band, greater than the sum over
all hopping terms. Because of this and the fact that perturbation potential
is about the size of a single lattice site, as we have seen in the previous
chapter, we will reduce ourselves to the nearest-neighbor hopping term
$J^n_1$.

\section{Conclusion}

Through the Planck-Einstein formula $E=hf$, one can express energies as
frequencies.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/scale/frequency.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Nearest-neighbor hopping energy as frequency and relative energy
    band differences with respect as frequency.
  }\label{fig:scale_frequency}
\end{figure}
We have used $f=E/h$ to express the nearest-neighbor hopping and band
energies relative to ground level as frequency. The so obtained
frequencies should give us the magnitude of the sweep frequencies used for our
envisioned perturbation potential in order for the time-average to hold.
\Cref{fig:scale_frequency} discloses the frequencies of hopping and band
energies relative to the first energy band. We note that the hopping
frequencies of the first four energy bands are in the single digit
\si{\kilo\hertz} range while the energy band frequencies of the first four
energy bands releative to the first energy band go up to \SI{40}{\kilo\hertz}.
The energy band frequencies are obviously higher then the hopping frequency,
and thus should be a better upper bound. Regardless, it is left for discussion
if the hopping frequencies are not more relevant for the ungoing physics. For
the now we will take \SI{50}{\kilo\hertz} as an upper bound for generation
of time-averaged potentials. This relates to a maximum duration of
\SI{20}{\micro\second} the perturbation laser beam should spent between
being deflected to the same lattice site.
