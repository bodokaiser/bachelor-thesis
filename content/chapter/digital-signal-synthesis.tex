\chapter{Digital signal synthesis}\label{ch:digital_signal_synthesis}

\textit{The previous chapters have covered the physics of our application and
we were able to recover some technical requirements imposed on our
implementation. In this chapter we will review the fundamentals of digital
signal synthesis, the theory on which the \gls{dds} --- our \gls{rf} signal
source to control the \gls{aod} --- are based on. \gls{dds} offer some
distinct advantages over traditional analog synthesiser. For one they can
cover a wide frequency range with high tuning resolution. In contrast analog
devices have to be fitted to a narrow operation range and are subject to
variations caused by aging, thermal drift and manufacturing. In addition
\gls{dds} permit extremly fast, phase-continous frequency changes,
without the loop-settling behaviour known to analog devices. Overall these
advantages make the \gls{dds} an attractive solution for our application where
it is used as \gls{rf} signal source~\cite{ADTutDDS}.}

\section{Operating principle}

\Cref{fig:dds_simple_architecture} depicts a flow diagram of the components
that make up a simple \gls{dds}. Given a system clock frequency $f_\text{sys}$
and the desired output frequency $f_\text{out}$ one can derive the phase
accumulator increment
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\varphi
  =
  \left\lceil\frac{f_\text{out}}{f_\text{sys}}2^N\right\rceil
  \label{eq:dds_phase_increment},
\end{equation}
where $N$ denotes the number of bits the phase accumulator can store and
$\lceil\cdot\rceil$ is the ceiling function.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
  {../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/simple-architecture.pdf}
  \caption{Signal flow through a simple \gls{dds}. The output frequency
    determines a phase step $\Delta\varphi$ by which the accumulator is incremented at each
    clock cycle. The value of the phase accumulator is used for amplitude
    lookup of the desired output signal shape. A \gls{dac} samples the output
    signal which then is filtered to smooth the discrete \gls{dac} output.
  }\label{fig:dds_simple_architecture}
\end{figure}
For every clock cycle the phase accumulator is incremented by $\Delta\varphi$.
On overflow of the accumulator a new signal period starts. The phase
accumulator value is used to lookup the corresponding amplitude value of the
desired output signal shape. For example one can use a lookup table with the
values of a sinusoidal output signal. Alternatively one can omit the lookup
table and output a sawtooth output signal by suppling the phase accumulator
output directly to the \gls{dac} or a square wave signal output by suppling
the most significant bit directly. Finally a \gls{dac} converts the digital
amplitude value to an analog signal. An optional analog filter can be used to
smooth the discrete output. \Cref{tab:dds_parameters} discloses system
parameters used for our \gls{dds} model and the \gls{ad9910} we use in our
setup~\cite{AD9910}. Except for the precision which in practice is not the
same accross the phase accumulator, lookup table and \gls{dac} our model
parameters are choosen to be similar to the ones used in the setup.
\begin{table}[htb]

  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    & Example & \gls{ad9910} \\
    \midrule

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{System parameters used for our simplified \gls{dds} model and
    used in the \gls{ad9910}.
  }\label{tab:dds_parameters}
\end{table}
In \Cref{fig:dds_simple_output} the signal of our model \gls{dds} at different
processing stages with the model parameters from \cref{tab:dds_parameters} are
illustrated.

    phase accumulator value is used to lookup a sinusoidal amplitude value
    that is supplied to a \gls{dac}. The final result is smoothed using a
    filter.}\label{fig:dds_simple_output}
\end{figure}
In the first column of \Cref{fig:dds_simple_output} we can see how the phase
accumulator is incremented on every clock iteration and resets on overflow.
In the second column the lookup table has been used to return the
corresponding cosine amplitude. We can see a difference in output shape
between even and odd samples. This is caused by the fact that the phase
increment is not a divisor of the phase accumulator size and we will later
discuss workarounds.

\subsection{Clock generation}

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that for a given sample rate a
perfect reconstruction is guaranteed possible for
$f_\text{out}<f_\text{samp}/2$. Until now we have considered the system clock
frequency $f_\text{sys}=f_\text{samp}$ as given. In practice reliable
reference signals are clocked below the desired output range and thereby
cannot directly be used as system clock according to the Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
  {../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/clock-generation.pdf}
  \caption{Clock generation signal generation with \gls{pll} and multiplier.
    The phase detector compares the output system phase with the reference
    phase and yields a non-linear error response. The low-pass filter removes
    fast oscillations. The \gls{vco} changes the output phase in dependence
    of the error response. Finally system and reference phase will go in lock.
    }\label{fig:dds_clock_generation}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:dds_clock_generation} the system clock generation from a
reference signal is illustrated. The phase detector yields a non-linear error
response comparing the output signal phase with the reference signal phase.
After a low-pass filter removes fast oscillations a \gls{vco} changes its
phase proportional to the error signal. Finally a frequency multiplier creates
harmonics of the reference frequency and extracts a programmed frequency
multiple of $M$ such that the system frequency relates to the reference
clock by $f_\text{sys}=Mf_\text{ref}$ with $\mathbb{N}\ni M>1$.

\subsection{Parameter modulation}

So far we only discussed the case of frequency modulation of the generated
output signal, however,wWe will see that it can be easily extended to support
amplitude and phase modulation too.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
  {../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/modulation-architecture.pdf}
  \caption{\gls{dds} architecture supporting modulation of frequency,
    amplitude and phase offset parameters. Phase accumulator increment
    $\Delta\varphi(t)$ is now time dependent. The phase offset $\varphi_0(t)$
    is also time dependent and is added as a last step to the phase
    accumulator before supplied to the \gls{dac}. The time dependent amplitude
    parameter $A_n(t)$ is multiplied with the amplitude obtained from the
    lookup table.
  }\label{fig:dds_modulation_architecture}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:dds_modulation_architecture} we can see one realization of an
architecture that supports amplitude, frequency and phase modulation. The main
components are the same as in \Cref{fig:dds_simple_architecture}. In addition
we have an adder for a time dependent phase offset and a multiplier for the
digital amplitude value obtained from the lookup table. The time dependence
of the parameters can be either determined by reading from memory or through
generation of another circuit. In a later section we will discuss the case of
a linear frequency sweep provided by a digital ramp.

\section{Quantization effects}

At the beginning of this chapter we elaborated greatly on the advantages that
digital signal synthesis has to offer. Yet we know that every technical design
involves its unqiue set of compromises. One important part in any engineering
process is to carefully evaluate the implications of these compromises. In
that sense we will discuss the side-effects arising from the digital nature of
digital signal synthesis and what methods there exists to reduce them.

\subsubsection{Phase jitter}

Phase jitter is created when one configures an output frequency for which
$\Delta\varphi$ is not a divider of $2^N$. In this case a phase error builds
up in each clock cycle~\cite{Vankka2013}. According to
\begin{equation}
  \frac{f_\text{out}}{f_\text{sys}}2^N-\Delta\varphi
  \label{eq:dds_phase_error},
\end{equation}
with the phase accumulator increment $\Delta\varphi$ defined in
\cref{eq:dds_phase_increment}, we have a phase error of $.4$ per clock cycle
for the model system parameters listed in \Cref{tab:dds_parameters}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/phase-error.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Phase error for system model parameters in
    \Cref{tab:dds_parameters} when comparing phase accumulator with
    $2^N=256$ and $250$ values.
  }\label{fig:dds_phase_error}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:dds_phase_error} the phase error is visualized for a phase
accumulator with $2^N=256$ values and $250$ values. The later phase
accumulator value yields zero for the phase error defined in
\cref{eq:dds_phase_error} and thereby represents the ideal signal. In the
first row of \Cref{fig:dds_phase_error} we can see how the phase error builds
up with every clock cycle. After $255$ cycles the phase error resets. In the
second row we can see how the output signal with phase error differs from the
idea output signal where no phase error is present. In the last row we see the
power spectrum of the ideal and erroneous output signal. Because the
instantaneous frequency relates to the change in phase of a periodic signal,
we can see how the linear increasing phase error shifts the output frequency
to the right.

\subsubsection{Phase truncation}

Phase truncation occurs because the amplitude lookup table and \gls{dac}
usually have a reduced precision $P$ compared to the phase accumulator. 
Fortunately there are many procedures to use the limited memory of a sinewave
lookup table more efficiently. For example one can reduce the sinewave data to
the domain from $0$ to $\pi/4$ and use symmetry to infer the values from
$\pi/4$ to $2\pi$. Sophisticated compressions methods allow compression ratios
up to 165:1~\cite{Cordesses2004} so that in practice phase truncation is not a
problem.

There of course exists other sources of signal imperfection from which
many can be described analytically~\cite{Goldberg1994}. 

\section{Frequency response}

Beside the previously discussed signal shape deviations caused by finite
precision, sampling theory predicts a $\sinc$ frequency response of
the amplitude for the \gls{dac}~\cite{Oppenheim1997}. Let us considers the
discrete-time signal obtained from amplitude lookup table of the \gls{dds}
\begin{equation}
  x(t)
  =A(t)\sum_n \delta(t-nT)
  =\sum_n A(nT)\delta(t-nT)
  =\sum_n A_n\delta(t-nT)
  \label{eq:signal_sampled},
\end{equation}
where we define the delta distribution to be
\begin{align}
  \delta\colon\mathbb{R} &\to \{0,\infty\}\\
  t &\mapsto \delta(t):=
  \begin{cases}
    \infty, & \text{if }t=0\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:delta},
\end{align}
and the sum is evaluated over the total number of samples and
$T=1/f_\text{sys}$ denotes the sampling period. Most \gls{dac} --- including
the \gls{dac} integrated into the \gls{ad9910} --- perform signal
reconstruction by zero-order hold. In zero-order hold a sample is hold for
one sample interval, this can be expressed by
\begin{equation}
  y(t)
  =
  \sum_n A_n\rect\left(\frac{t-Tn}{T}\right)
  \label{eq:signal_reconstructed},
\end{equation}
where the sum has to be taken over the number of sampled points, and
\begin{align}
  \rect\colon\mathbb{R} &\to \{0,1\}\\
  t &\mapsto \rect(t):=
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if }0\leq t<1\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rect},
\end{align}
being the piecewise-constant output signal of the \gls{dac}. The \gls{dac}
output can be modeleled through a linear transfer function $h$ that relates
to the input $x$ and output signal $y$ by convolution
\begin{equation}
  y(t)
  =
  \left(x\circledast h\right)(t).
  \label{eq:signal_transfer}
\end{equation}
The sampled \cref{eq:signal_sampled} and the reconstructed signal
\cref{eq:signal_reconstructed} in the frequency domain read
\begin{align}
  X(\omega)&=\sum_n x_n e^{-i\omega n T}
  \label{eq:signal_sampled_fourier}\\
  Y(\omega)&=\sum_n x_n e^{-i\omega n T}
  Te^{-i\omega T/2}\sinc\left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right)
  \label{eq:signal_reconstructed_fourier},
\end{align}
where we define the $\sinc$ function to be
\begin{align}
  \sinc\colon\mathbb{R} &\to \mathbb{R}\\
  x &\mapsto \sinc(x):=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{\sin(x)}{x}, & t\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\\
    1, & t=0
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:sinc}.
\end{align}
According to the Convolution theorem the convolution of two functions in the
time domain equals the product of the two functions in the frequency domain,
thus by using
\begin{equation}
  Y(\omega)
  =X(\omega)H(\omega)
  \label{eq:transfer_fourier},
\end{equation}
\cref{eq:signal_sampled_fourier} and \cref{eq:signal_reconstructed_fourier},
we can easily read of the transfer function in the frequency domain
\begin{equation}
  H(\omega)
  =Te^{-i\omega T/2}\sinc\left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
As we are interested in the relative power of the \gls{dac} integrated into
the \gls{dds} we need to look at the relative power transfer with respect to
the output frequency $f_\text{out}$
\begin{equation}
  \abs{\frac{H\left(f_\text{out}\right)}{f_\text{sys}}}^2
  =\sinc^2\left(\pi\frac{f_\text{out}}{f_\text{sys}}\right).
\end{equation}
We visualized the frequency roll-off of the \gls{dac} in
\Cref{fig:dds_dac_response} from zero to the Nyqiost frequency
$f_\text{sys}/2$.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/response.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Power transfer of the \gls{dac} according to the zero-order hold
    model with respect to relative output frequency from zero to the Nyquist
    frequency $f_\text{sys}/2$. In the second plot we see the power transfer
    for the later operating range of the \gls{dds}.
  }\label{fig:dds_dac_response}
\end{figure}
For the parameters used in \Cref{tab:dds_parameters},
$f_\text{sys}=\SI{1}{\giga\hertz}$, we can also read the relative frequency
scale as \si{\giga\hertz}. In the second plot we show the frequency range
\SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz} which we will use as the operating range
for our \gls{dds}. For said operating range the power falls off linearly by
about \SI{2.6}{\percent}.

\section{Digital ramp and playback}

In this last section we will discuss frequency and amplitude modulation by
the digital ramp and memory playback integrated into the \gls{ad9910},
therefore the following insights will be very specific to the \gls{ad9910}.
The digital ramp is used to implement sweep modulation with constant
increments. In our case we will use the digital ramp to sweep the frequency
applied to the \gls{aod} from \SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz}. The playback
mode allows modulation from memory. We can use it to define up to \num{1024}
distinct amplitude values in order to indirectly modulate efficiency of the
diffraction of the \gls{aod}. Both digital ramp and memory playback are
controled by a timer that is clocked with
\begin{equation}
  f_{\text{timer}}
  =f_{\text{sys}}/4
  =\SI{250}{\mega\hertz}
  \label{eq:dds_timer}.
\end{equation}
The sample interval of the memory playback is controlled by a $\SI{16}{\bit}$
playback rate word
\begin{equation}
  \Delta t_\text{mem}
  =\frac{P}{f_\text{timer}}
  =\frac{4P}{f_\text{sys}}
  \label{eq:dds_playback_rate}.
\end{equation}
In \Cref{fig:dds_playback_rate} we illustrate the playback sample interval
and total playback duration when using the complete playback memory in
dependency of the playback rate word $P$.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/digital-signal-synthesis/playback-rate.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Playback sample interval and total playback duration when using the
    complete \num{1024} memory points in dependency of the playback rate word
    $P$.
  }\label{fig:dds_playback_rate}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{tab:dds_playback_rate} we present the minimal and maximal playback
parameters. The maximum duration of one iteration through all playback values
$T$ will limit the duration of the digital ramp as we will see later.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Rate Word $P$ &
    Sample Interval $\Delta t_\text{mem}$ &
    Duration $T_\text{mem}$ \\
    \midrule
    \num{1} &
    \SI{4}{\nano\second} &
    \SI{4.096}{\milli\second} \\
    \num{65 536} &
    \SI{262.144}{\micro\second} &
    \SI{268.435456}{\milli\second} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Minimal and maximal playback parameters of the \gls{ad9910}
  according to \cref{eq:dds_playback_rate} with
  $f_\text{sys}=\SI{1}{\giga\hertz}$.
  }\label{tab:dds_playback_rate}
\end{table}

The digital ramp allows amplitude, frequency or phase offset modulation with
constant increments. In our setup we use the digital ramp to sweep the
frequency range \SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz} to change the beam deflection
angle via \gls{aod}. In \Cref{tab:dds_dramp_register} the register of the
digital ramp to perform frequency increments are listed.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    Lower Limit $L$ &
    Upper Limit $U$ &
    Step Size $S$ &
    Step Rate $R$ \\
    \midrule
    \SI{32}{\bit} &
    \SI{32}{\bit} &
    \SI{32}{\bit} &
    \SI{16}{\bit} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Digital ramp register that control the frequency and their
    respective presicion.
  }\label{tab:dds_dramp_register}
\end{table}
The lower and upper limits are related to the start and final frequency of a
sweep by
\begin{align}
  L=\left\lfloor2^{32}\frac{f_\text{start}}{f_\text{sys}}\right\rceil &&
  U=\left\lfloor2^{32}\frac{f_\text{final}}{f_\text{sys}}\right\rceil
  \label{eq:dds_dramp_limits},
\end{align}
where $\lfloor\cdot\rceil$ maps to the closest integer. In
\Cref{tab:dds_dramp_limits} we present the digital ramp limit register values
for a frequency sweep from \SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz} as used for later
measurements.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Register & Value & Quantity \\
    \midrule
    Lower Limit $L$ & \num{343 597 384} & \SI{80}{\mega\hertz} \\
    Upper Limit $U$ & \num{515 396 076} & \SI{120}{\mega\hertz} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Digital ramp limit registers for a frequency sweep from
    \SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz}.
  }\label{tab:dds_dramp_limits}
\end{table}
The slope rate $R$ and the step size $S$ relate to the frequency and time
increments via
\begin{align}
  \Delta t_\text{ramp}=\frac{R}{f_\text{timer}}=\frac{4R}{f_\text{sys}} &&
  \Delta f_\text{ramp}=\frac{S}{2^{32}}f_\text{sys}
  \label{eq:dds_dramp_steps}.
\end{align}
In the driver we set $R$ and $S$ indirectly through the sweep duration
\begin{equation}
  T_\text{ramp}
  =
  \frac{U-L}{S}\frac{4R}{f_\text{sys}}
  \Delta t_\text{ramp}
  \label{eq:dds_dramp_duration}.
\end{equation}
The integer ratio $R/S$ is found using best-ratio approximation as described
in Ref.~\cite{Ashley2003}. In \Cref{tab:dds_dramp_steps} the step register
values of the digital ramp for the most common sweep duration of
\SI{260}{\milli\second} used in our measurements are listed.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Register & Value & Quantity \\
    \midrule
    Step Size $S$ & \num{42949673} & \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} \\
    Step Rate $R$ & \num{16250112} & \SI{65}{\milli\second} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Digital ramp step registers for a frequency sweep from
    \SIrange{80}{120}{\mega\hertz} with duration
    $T_\text{ramp}=\SI{260}{\milli\second}$.
  }\label{tab:dds_dramp_steps}
\end{table}
The increments reported in \Cref{tab:dds_dramp_steps} are converted
internally in the \gls{ad9910} and applied to the phase accumulator of the
\gls{ad9910}, thus even though the step size and rate are large compared to
the sweep duration and frequency range, the effective frequency increments
are of finer scale as we later measurements will show. Unfortunately the
datasheet of the \gls{ad9910}~\cite{AD9910} does not disclose any details on
the exact conversion of the digital ramp steps to the phase accumulator,
such that we cannot estimate the effective frequency resolution of the digital
ramp of the \gls{ad9910}.

\section{Frequency and time resolution}

Although we cannot give the exact frequency resolution imposed by the digital
ramp of the \gls{ad9910}, we can compare the possible time scales of the
digital ramp and memory playback mode with the time scales found in
\cref{ch:energy_scales}. Furthermore the specified frequency resolution
of \SI{230}{\milli\hertz} in the constant frequency operation mode of the
\gls{dds} can give us a rough estimate of the achievable spatial resolution.

The time scale of the \gls{ad9910} are limited by the playback duration time
\begin{equation}
  T_\text{mem}
  =N\frac{4P}{f_\text{sys}}
  \label{eq:dds_playback_duration},
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of memory words used. The \gls{ad9910} supports up to
$N=1024$ memory words. Using the fact that $P$ is of \SI{16}{\bit} precision
we can calculate the minimal and maximal durations times for the \gls{dds}.
\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Memory Words $N$ & Playback Rate $P$ & Duration $T$ \\
    \midrule
    \num{1} & \num{1} & \SI{4}{\nano\second} \\
    \num{1024} & \num{1} & \SI{4}{\micro\second} \\
    \num{1} & \num{65536} & \SI{262}{\micro\second} \\
    \num{1024} & \num{65536} & \SI{268}{\milli\second} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Time scales of the \gls{ad9910} imposed by the technical limits of
    the playback duration time of the \gls{ad9910}.
  }\label{tab:dds_time_scale}
\end{table}
In \Cref{tab:dds_time_scale} we are presented the possible time scales
imposed by the playback duration time of the \gls{ad9910}. From
\cref{ch:energy_scales} we know that a good time scale would be about
\SI{10}{\nano\second}. We can see that for $P=1$ and $N=2$ we could --- in
principle --- achieve a duration time of below $\SI{10}{\nano\second}$ and
realize a \gls{1d} potential barrier with two distinct frequencyes as
illustrated in \cref{ch:optical_potentials}. Ref.~\cite{Hertlein2017}
discloses a linear model for the spatial resolution in the atomic plane in
terms of the \gls{aod} frequencies
\begin{align}
  x(f_h)/\si{\micro\meter}=3.66\frac{f_h}{\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}}-379 &&
  y(f_v)/\si{\micro\meter}=3.62\frac{f_v}{\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}}-360
  \label{eq:spatial_position_frequency},
\end{align}
wherein $f_h,f_v$ denote the frequencies applied the \gls{h} respective
\gls{v} \gls{aod}. Neglecting frequency dependent amplification the frequency
resolution of $\Delta f=\SI{230}{\milli\hertz}$ translates to a spatial
resolution of about
\begin{equation}
  \Delta x\approx \Delta y\approx\SI{8}{\pico\meter}
  \label{eq:spatial_resolution}.
\end{equation}
We conclude that there are other effects that limit the spatial resolution
before \cref{eq:spatial_resolution} will become relevant.
