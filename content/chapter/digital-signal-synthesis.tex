\chapter{Digital signal synthesis}\label{ch:digital_signal_synthesis}

The previous chapters have covered the physical theory behind our targeted
application. From that we were able to recover some technical requirements
imposed on our implementation. In this chapter we will review the fundamentals
of digital signal synthesis as \gls{rf} signal source to control the \gls{aod}.

\gls{dds} offer some distinct advantages over traditional analog synthesiser.
For one they can cover up a wide frequency range with high tuning resolution.
In contrast thereto analog devices have to be fitted to a narrow operation
range and are subject to variations caused by aging, thermal drift and
manufacturing. In addition \gls{dds} permit extremly fast, phase-continous
changes of the output signal parameters, without the loop-settling behaviour
known to analog devices. Most recently \gls{dds} can easily be integrated into
existing digital circuits giving rise to a cost-competitive remote
controllable device. Overall these advantages make the \gls{dds} an attractive
solution for our projected application \gls{rf} signal source \cite{ADTutDDS}.

\section{Operating principle}

\Cref{fig:dds_simple_architecture} depicts a flow diagram of the components
that make up a simple \gls{dds}. Given a system clock frequency $f_\text{sys}$
and the desired output frequency $f_\text{out}$ one can derive the phase
accumulator increment
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\varphi
  =
  \lceil\frac{f_\text{out}}{f_\text{sys}}2^N+\frac{1}{2}\rceil
  \label{eq:dds_phase_increment}
\end{equation}
where $N$ denotes the number of bits the phase accumulator can store.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{digital-signal-synthesis/simple-architecture.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{Signal flow through a simple \gls{dds}. The output frequency
    determines a phase step by which the accumulator is incremented at each
    clock cycle. The value of the phase accumulator is used for amplitude
    lookup of the desired output signal shape. A \gls{dac} outputs the signal
    which then is filtered to smooth the discrete \gls{dac} output.
  }\label{fig:dds_simple_architecture}
\end{figure}
For every clock cycle the phase accumulator is incremented by $\Delta\varphi$.
On overflow of the accumulator a new signal period starts. The phase
accumulator value is used to lookup the corresponding amplitude value of the
desired output signal shape. For example one can use a lookup table with the
values of a sinusoidal output signal. Alternatively one can omit the lookup
table and output a sawtooth output signal by suppling the phase accumulator
output directly to the \gls{dac} or a square wave signal output by suppling
the most significant bit directly. Finally a \gls{dac} converts the digital
amplitude value to an analog signal. An optional analog filter can be used to
smooth the discrete output. In \Cref{fig:dds_simple_output} the signal at the
different processing stages inside a simple \gls{dds} are presented for a
\SI{8}{\bit} precision, system clock frequency
$f_\text{sys}=\SI{1}{\giga\hertz}$ and output frequency
$f_\text{out}=\SI{100}{\mega\hertz}$.
\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{digital-signal-synthesis/simple-output.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{Signal outputs at different stages in a simple \gls{dds}. The
    phase accumulator is incremented at each clock cycle by $\Delta\phi$. The
    phase accumulator value is used to lookup a sinusoidal amplitude value
    that is supplied to a \gls{dac}. The final result is smoothed using a
    filter.}\label{fig:dds_simple_output}
\end{figure}
In the first column of \Cref{fig:dds_simple_output} we can see how the phase
accumulator is incremented on every clock iteration and resets on overflow.
In the second column the lookup table has been used to return the
corresponding cosine amplitude. We can see a difference in output shape
between even and odd samples. This is caused by the fact that the phase
increment is not a divisor of the phase accumulator size and we will later
discuss workarounds.

\subsection{Clock generation}

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that for a given sample rate a
perfect reconstruction is guaranteed possible for
$f_\text{out}<f_\text{samp}/2$. Until now we have considered the system clock
frequency $f_\text{sys}=f_\text{samp}$ as given. In practice reliable
reference signals are clocked below the desired output range and thereby
cannot directly be used as system clock according to the Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{digital-signal-synthesis/clock-generation.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{Clock generation signal generation with \gls{pll} and multiplier.
    The phase detector compares the output system phase with the reference
    phase and yields a non-linear error response. The low-pass filter removes
    fast oscillations. The \gls{vco} changes the output phase in dependence
    of the error response. Finally system and reference phase will go in lock.
    }\label{fig:dds_clock_generation}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:dds_clock_generation} the system clock generation from a reference
signal is illustrated. The phase detector yields a non-linear error response
comparing the output signal phase with the reference signal phase. After a
low-pass filter removes fast oscillations a \gls{vco} changes its phase
proportional to the error signal. Finally a frequency multiplier creates
harmonics of the reference frequency and extracts a programmed frequency
multiple of $M$ such that the system frequency relates to the reference
clock by $f_\text{sys}=Mf_\text{ref}$ with $1<M\in\mathbb{N}$.

\subsection{Parameter modulation}

So far we only discussed the case of frequency modulation. We will see that
the previous architecture can be easily extended to support amplitude
and phase modulation too.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{digital-signal-synthesis/modulation-architecture.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{
    \gls{dds} architecture supporting modulation of frequency, amplitude and
    phase offset parameters. Phase accumulator increment is now time dependent.
    The phase offset is also time dependent is added as last step to the
    phase accumulator before supplied to the \gls{dac}. The time dependent
    amplitude parameter is multiplied with the amplitude obtained from the
    lookup table.
    }\label{fig:dds_modulation_architecture}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:dds_modulation_architecture} we can see one realization of an
architecture that supports amplitude, frequency and phase modulation. The main
components are the same as in \Cref{fig:dds_simple_architecture}. In addition
we have an adder for a time dependent phase offset and a multiplier for the
digital amplitude value obtained from the lookup table. The time dependence
of the parameters can be either determined by reading from memory or through
generation of another circuit. In a later section we will discuss the case of
a linear frequency sweep provided by a digital ramp.

\section{Quantization errors}
\section{Frequency response}

\section{Operating range}

We apply a reference signal of
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{ref}=\SI{10}{\mega\hertz}
\end{equation}
configured to be used with a \gls{pll} multiplier of
$N=100$ yielding a system clock of
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{sys}=Nf_\text{ref}=\SI{1}{\giga\hertz}.
\end{equation}
The timer clock used for the linear ramp and memory playback runs with
a quarter of the system clock
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{timer}=f_\text{sys}/4=\SI{250}{\mega\hertz}.
\end{equation}

The \gls{ad9910} uses a \SI{14}{\bit} \gls{asf} and \SI{32}{\bit} \gls{ftw}
to parameterize amplitude $A(t)$ and output frequency $f(t)$ by
\begin{align}
  FTW
  :=
  \left\lfloor2^{32}\left(\frac{f_\text{out}}{f_\text{sys}}\right)\right\rceil
  &&
  ASF
  :=
  \left\lfloor\frac{A_\text{out}}{2^{14}}\right\rceil
  \label{eq:elec:ftwasf}
\end{align}
wherein $\lfloor{\cdot}\rceil$ rounds the given float to the nearest integer.
The theoretical limit for the maximum output frequency then is found via
\begin{equation*}
  f_\text{max}
  =
  \left(1-\frac{2^{31}-1}{2^{32}}\right)f_\text{sys}
  =
  \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2^{31}}\right)f_\text{sys}
  \approx
  \frac{1}{2}f_\text{sys}
  =
  \SI{500}{\mega\hertz}.
\end{equation*}
Yet the datasheet \cite{AD9910} reports $f_\text{max}=\SI{420}{\mega\hertz}$
and in fact we found the output signal to be very noisy at the theoretical
limit.

We continue with the assessment of the digital ramp that does a unidrectional
linear sweep on the frequency from \SI{90}{\mega\hertz} to
\SI{110}{\mega\hertz}. The digital ramp of the \gls{ad9910} lets us define
a \gls{ftw} step $M$ word of \SI{32}{\bit} as well as a step rate word $S$ of
\SI{16}{\bit} resolution. They relate to the frequency step and the time
step through
\begin{align}
  \Delta f
  =
  \frac{M}{2^{32}}f_\text{sys}
  &&
  \Delta t
  =
  \frac{S}{f_\text{timer}}
  =
  \frac{S}{4f_\text{sys}}.
  \label{eq:elec:step}
\end{align}
The sweep duration is deterimened by $S,M$ through
\begin{equation}
  T_\text{duration}
  =
  \frac{f_\text{upper}-f_\text{lower}}{\Delta f}\Delta t
  =
  2^{32}\frac{f_\text{upper}-f_\text{lower}}{f_\text{sys}}\frac{S/M}{f_\text{timer}}
\end{equation}
for a target sweep duration of $T_\text{duration}=\SI{10}{ms}$ we find
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{S}{M}
  =
  \frac{T f_\text{timer}}{2^{32}}\frac{f_\text{sys}}{f_\text{upper}-f_\text{lower}}
  =
  \frac{10^9}{2^{35}}
  \approx
  \num{2.9104e-2}
  =
  \frac{1819}{62500}
\end{equation*}
the last step can be obtained by best ratio approximation using continued
fractions as for example described in \cite{Ashley2003}. It should be kept in
mind that the best ratio approximation is likable to introduce an error,
therefore realistic durations may differ from the configured value and it
is possible that better approximations exist that allow smaller $\Delta f,
\Delta t$, thus providing a sweep resolution. In the above case the given
time duration translates to
\begin{align*}
  \Delta f
  =
  \frac{62500}{2^{32}}f_\text{sys}
  \approx
  \SI{145}{\kilo\hertz}
  &&
  \Delta t
  =
  \frac{1819}{f_\text{timer}}
  \approx
  \SI{7.28}{\micro\second}
\end{align*}
or $(f_\text{upper}-f_\text{lower})/\Delta f=138$ discrete data points.

Eventually we are left with the assessment of the amplitude sequence. The
memory fits at most 1024 discrete amplitude values and the \gls{ad9910}
allows us to set the time spent at each amplitude value via the \SI{16}{\bit}
playback rate $P$ word
\begin{equation}
  \Delta t
  =
  \frac{P}{f_\text{timer}}
  =
  \frac{4P}{f_\text{sys}}
\end{equation}
which gives us range from $\min\Delta t=\SI{4}{\nano\second}$ to
$\max\Delta t=\SI{26.14}{\micro\second}$. As we incorporate all of the 1024
data points this gives us a duration range from about
$\min T=\SI{4}{\micro\second}$ to $\max T=\SI{26.84}{\milli\second}$.
