\chapter{Optical potentials}

\textit{In the introduction we emphasized the importance of optical lattices,
yet we left out many details, for instance, how these optical lattices are
created and how the optical quantities enter the potential energy of the
atoms. In this chapter we will make up for said gaps. First we will
recapitulate the theory behind laser light intensities and then derive a
formulation of the effective lattice potentials felt by the atoms.}

\section{Atom-light interaction}

At first we need to ask ourselves how the laser field acts as a perturbation
to the Hamiltonian of the atomic system and how this perturbation leads to an
intensity dependent potential for the atoms, which we can control in the
experiment. In deviations are loosely based on
references~\cite{Gerry2004,Jackson2005,Bartelmann2018}.

\subsection{Dipole potential}

We will use \gls{si} units unless stated otherwise. The Hamiltonian of an electron
in an external electromagnetic field reads
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_\text{em}
  =\frac{1}{2m_e}{\left(\hat{\vb{p}}+e\vb{A}\right)}^2-e\Phi+\hat{V}_0
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_em},
\end{equation}
with vector potential $\vb{A}$ and scalar potential $\Phi$ of the external
field and the Coulomb potential of the nucleus $\hat{V}_0$. Further $m_e$
denotes the electron mass and $e$ the elementary charge.
\Cref{eq:hamiltonian_em} is exact for the hydrogen atom that only hosts one
electron. For alkali atoms we know that inner electron shells are closed and
the single outer electron is approximately described by
\cref{eq:hamiltonian_em}. The electromagnetic field relates to the
vector and scalar potential through
\begin{align}
  \vb{E}=-\grad{\Phi}-\pdv{\vb{A}}{t}, &&
  \vb{B}=\curl{\vb{A}},
  \label{eq:field_em_potentials}
\end{align}
where $\vb{E}$ is the electric and $\vb{B}$ the magnetic field component.

The representation used in \cref{eq:field_em_potentials} is actually difficult
to work with. Fortunately Gauge freedom allows us to transform
\cref{eq:field_em_potentials} to a more simple form. We usually only consider
the electromagnetic field to represent physical reality, thus Gauge freedom
describes physical redunancy in mathematically distinct
solutions.\footnote{The Aharonov-Bohm effect actually provides evidence that
also the electromagnetic potentials represent physical reality.}

Gauge freedom of the
electromagnetic vector and scalar potential permit transformations of kind
\begin{align}
  \vb{A}\to\vb{A}+\grad{\chi}
  &&
  \Phi\to\Phi-\pdv{\chi}{t}
  \label{eq:gauge_transform_em}
\end{align}
with gauge function $\chi(\vb{x},t)$.

We can see that insertion of \cref{eq:gauge_transform_em} into
\cref{eq:field_em_potentials} and applying vector calculus identities yields
expressions for the electromagnetic field components independent of the gauge
function $\chi$. 
In the following we choose the gauge function $\chi=-\vb{A}\cdot\vb{x}$ and
assume the dipole approximation $\vb{A}(\vb{x},t)\approx\vb{A}(t)$. The
dipole approximation is reasonable as wave length of visible light are much
larger then atomic length scales\cite{Gerry2004}. In the dipole
approximation $\chi$ satisfies the Coulomb gauge condition
$\divergence{\vb{A}}=0$ allowing us to set $\Phi=0$ as no external sources
are present\cite{Jackson2005}. Finally we can rewrite
\cref{eq:hamiltonian_em} as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_\text{dip}
  =\frac{\hat{\vb{p}}^2}{2m}+\hat{V}_0+\hat{V}_\text{dip}
  =\hat{H}_0+\hat{V}_\text{dip}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_dip}
\end{equation}
with the dipole potential
\begin{equation}
  \hat{V}_\text{dip}
  =-\hat{\vb{d}}\cdot\vb{E}
  \label{eq:potential_dip},
\end{equation}
dipole operator $\hat{\vb{d}}=-e\vb{x}$ and spatially homogeneous light
field $\vb{E}(t)$.

\subsection{Effective potential}

We are now going to solve \cref{eq:hamiltonian_dip} for an arbitrary light
field of the form
\begin{equation}
  \vb{E}(t,\vb{x})
  =\vb{E}_0(\vb{x})\cos(\omega t)
  \label{eq:light_field}
\end{equation}
where $\vb{E}_0(\vb{x})$ should be compatible with Maxwell's equations and
be approximately constant on atomic length scales to not infringe with the
dipole approximation. Further we need the laser frequency $\omega$ to be
far-off-resonant to the atomic transition frequencies to avoid population
dynamics.

At $t<0$ the system is in the energy eigenstate $\ket{n}$ of the
unperturbated Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}_0\ket{n}
  =E_n\ket{n}
  =\hbar\omega_n\ket{n}
  \label{eq:eigenvalue_energy_unperturbated}.
\end{equation}
At $t>0$ the external light field appears instantaneous. The new state
$\ket{\psi}$ can be expanded in the complete base of the previous energy
eigenstates
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi}
  =
  \sum_n{c_n(t)}{e^{-i{\omega_n}t}}\ket{n}
  \label{eq:state_expansion_unperturbated}.
\end{equation}
Inserting \cref{eq:state_expansion_unperturbated} into the time-dependent
SchrÃ¶dinger equation with dipole Hamiltonian \cref{eq:hamiltonian_dip} and
applying $\bra{m}{e^{i{\omega_m}t}}$ to the right hand side leads us to a set
of differential equations
\begin{equation}
  \dot{c}_m
  =
  -\frac{i}{\hbar}\sum_n{c_n(t)}{e^{-i\omega_{nm}t}}
  \bra{m}\hat{V}_\text{dip}\ket{n}
  \label{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics}
\end{equation}
with $\omega_{nm}=\omega_n-\omega_m$. One can read
\cref{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics} as the probability
amplitude change in time of a state $m$ is equal to the the sum of
oscillations to between states $n$ and $m$ weighted by the current population
$c_n(t)$ of state $n$ and the interaction strength. If we are able to solve
\cref{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics} for $c_n(t)$ the
population dynamics are entirely described by the time-dependent probability
$\abs{c_n(t)}^2$. By using \cref{eq:light_field} we can rewrite the dipole
transition matrix elements
\begin{equation}
  \bra{m}\hat{V}_\text{dip}\ket{n}
  =\Omega_{nm}(\vb{x})\cos(\omega t)\hbar
  \label{eq:elements_dipole_transition_matrix}
\end{equation}
where we introduced the Rabi frequency
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_{nm}(\vb{x})
  =\bra{n}\hat{\vb{d}}\cdot\vb{E}_0(\vb{x})\ket{m}/\hbar
  \label{eq:rabi_frequency}.
\end{equation}
Explicit values for general dipole transition elements for one and two
electron systems can be found in~\cite{Bethe1957}. Transition elements
vanishes for states with same parity, in particular
$\Omega_{nn}=0$~\cite{Bartelmann2018}.

\subsubsection{Two state system}

From now on we assume a two state system that initially is only populated in
the ground state $c_g(0)=1,c_e(0)=0$. For ultracold atoms which only populate
the first two energy states this is a very good approximation. Under these
circumstances the dynamics described in
\cref{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics} simplify to
\begin{align}
  i\dot{c}_g=\Omega_0c_e(t)\cos(\omega t)e^{+i\omega_0 t} &&
  i\dot{c}_e=\Omega_0c_g(t)\cos(\omega t)e^{-i\omega_0 t}
  \label{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics_two_state_system}
\end{align}
with $\Omega_0=\Omega_{ge}(\vb{x})$. Expansion of $\cos(\omega t)$ in terms
of the exponential function and dropping $e^{\pm i(\omega+\omega_0)t}$ yields
\begin{align}
  i\dot{c}_g\approx\frac{\Omega_0}{2}c_e(t)e^{+i\Delta\omega t} &&
  i\dot{c}_e\approx\frac{\Omega_0}{2}c_g(t)e^{-i\Delta\omega t}
  \label{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics_two_state_system_rwa}
\end{align}
where we introduced the frequency detuning
$\Delta\omega=\abs{\omega-\omega_0}$. The so-called rotating wave
approximation is motivated by the fact that oscillations of frequency
$\omega+\omega_0$ are fast compared to changes in the population dynamics and
therefore vanish on average.

We now define $a_g=c_g$ and $a_e=c_e e^{i\Delta\omega t}$ and refine
\cref{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics_two_state_system_rwa} by
\begin{align}
  i\dot{a}_g=\frac{\Omega_0}{2}a_e(t) &&
  i\dot{a}_e=\frac{\Omega_0}{2}a_g(t)-a_e\Delta\omega
  \label{eq:differential_equation_population_dynamics_two_state_system_shift}.
\end{align}
In the former form we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian and find energy
eigenvalues to be
\begin{equation}
  E_{e,g}
  =\frac{\hbar}{2}\left(-\Delta\omega\mp\sqrt{\Omega_0^2+\Delta\omega^2}\right)
  \approx
  \mp\frac{\hbar\Omega_0^2}{4\Delta\omega}
  \label{eq:eigenvalues_energy_light_shift}
\end{equation}
where we applied Taylor expansion to the square root for
$\Delta\omega\gg\Omega_0$.

\subsubsection{AC light shift}

In result atoms in an external off-resonant light field experience an
effective periodic dipole potential
\begin{equation}
  \hat{V}_\text{eff}(\vb{x})
  =
  \mp\frac{\hbar\Omega_0^2(\vb{x})}{4\Delta\omega}
  =
  \mp\frac{d_0^2E_0^2(\vb{x})}{4\hbar\Delta\omega}
  \label{eq:potential_effective}
\end{equation}
with dipole element $d_0$. The sign has to be chosen with respect to the
direction of the laser detuning from resonance. If the laser is redshifted
towards the resonance frequency, $\omega-\omega_0>0$, we need to choose the
negative sign as the particles are drawn towards the areas of maximum
intensity. The same results can also be obtained by the use of second order
perturbation theory, however the presented approach is more clear on
assumptions and time dependence\cite{Grimm2008}.

\section{Laser light fields}

In this section our focus will be on the laser light field that creates the
optical lattice potential and the laser light field that creates the
time-averaged dynamic potentials.

\subsection{Gaussian beams}

The predominant output mode of most lasers is the fundamental transverse
gaussian mode described by
\begin{equation}
  \vb{E}(r,z)
  =
  \vb{E}_0\frac{w(0)}{w(z)}
  \exp{-\frac{r^2}{w{(z)}^2}}
  \exp{-ik\left(z+\frac{r^2}{2R(z)}-\arctan(\frac{z}{z_R})\right)}
  \label{eq:gaussian_beam}
\end{equation}
where $w{(z)}$ is the waist radius, $z_R=\pi w{(0)}^2/\lambda$ the Rayleigh
range and $R(z)$ the radius of curvature of the beam's wavefronts at $z$.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{\mediadir{image/gaussian-beam.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.9\textwidth}
  \caption{Illustration of gaussian beam parameters from $\aleph$ (Aleph),
    http://commons.wikimedia.org translated into English with changed radius
    of curvature. The waist radius $w(z)$ relates to the beam width, $R(z)$
    relates to the wavefront curvature and $z_R$ is the distance from origin
    $z=0$ where the beam width is $w(z)=\sqrt{2}w(0)$.}\label{fig:gaussian_beam}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:gaussian_beam} unveils how the parameters relate to the beam
profile propagation. The waist radius $w(z)$ corresponds to the beam width,
$R(z)$ relates to the wavefront curvature and $z_R$ is the distance from
origin $z=0$ where the beam width is $w(z)=\sqrt{2}w(0)$. Beam width
and curvature radius evolve according to
\begin{align}
  w{(z)}
  =
  w{(0)}{\left[1+{\left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)}^2\right]}^{1/2}
  &&
  R{(z)}=z{\left[1+{\left(\frac{z_R}{z}\right)}^2\right]}
  \label{eq:gaussian_beam_evolvement}.
\end{align}

Fortunately \cref{eq:potential_effective} only depends on the absolute
square of the electric field, thus we can drop the complex exponential from
\cref{eq:gaussian_beam} to find an expression for the Gaussian intensity
distribution
\begin{equation}
  I(r,z)
  =
  I_0
  {\left(\frac{w(0)}{w(z)}\right)}^2
  \exp{-\frac{2r^2}{w{(z)}^2}}
  =
  I_0
  \frac{\exp{-\frac{2r^2}{w{(z)}^2}}}{1+{\left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)}^2}
  \label{eq:gaussian_intensity}
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at $r=z=0$.

\subsubsection{Lattice intensity}

An one dimensional optical lattices can be generated through the interference
of two counter-propagating Gaussian beams
\begin{align*}
  \vb{E}_\rightarrow(\vb{x},t)+\vb{E}_\leftarrow(\vb{x},t)
  &=
  \vb{E}_0(r,z)\cos(kz-\omega t)+\vb{E}_0(r,z)\cos(kz-\omega t)\\
  &=
  2\vb{E}_0(r,z)\cos(kz)\cos(\omega t)
\end{align*}
Therewith the intensity distribution equals
\cref{eq:gaussian_intensity} with an additional $4\cos^2(kz)$ factor
\begin{equation}
  I(z)
  =
  4I_0\cos^2(kz)
  \frac{\exp{-\frac{2r^2}{w{(z)}^2}}}{1+{\left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)}^2}
  \label{eq:lattice_intensity}
\end{equation}
contributed through the constructive interference.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Laser wavelength $\lambda$ &
    Lattice constant $a=\lambda/2$ &
    Beam waist $w(0)$ &
    Rayleigh length $z_R$ \\
    \hline
    \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} &
    \SI{532}{\nano\meter} &
    \SI{150}{\micro\meter} &
    \SI{66}{\milli\meter} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{Typical values for a Gaussian beam used to construct an optical
    lattice potential.
  }\label{tab:gaussian_beam_lattice}
\end{table}
\Cref{tab:gaussian_beam_lattice} lists typical values for a Gaussian beam
used to construct an optical lattice potential. Optical lattices have up to
50 lattice sites spanning over a range of
$l=50a\approx\SI{27}{\micro\meter}$~\cite{Rom2009}. For $-l/2<z<+l/2$ we find
that $w(z)\approx w(0)$ and because
$r\ll1$ we can approximate~\cref{eq:lattice_intensity} to follow
\begin{equation}
  I(z)
  \approx
  4I_0\cos^2(kz)
  \label{eq:gaussian_intensity_approx}
\end{equation}
which we will use from now on as the intenisty distribution for one
dimensional optical lattices.

\subsubsection{Perturbation intensity}

The laser beam used to perturbate the optical lattice potential has slightly
different parameters~\cite{Hertlein2017} as we can see in
\Cref{tab:gaussian_beam_perturbation}.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Laser wavelength $\lambda$ &
    Beam waist $w(0)$ &
    Rayleigh length $z_R$ \\
    \hline
    \SI{532}{\nano\meter} &
    \SI{1}{\micro\meter} &
    \SI{6}{\micro\meter} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionsetup{width=.8\textwidth}
  \caption{Typical values for a Gaussian beam used to perturbate the optical
    lattice potential reported by~\cite{Hertlein2017}.
  }\label{tab:gaussian_beam_perturbation}
\end{table}
For these parameters approximations made for optical lattice are not valid
because of the small beam waist and Rayleigh length and we need to the exact
\cref{eq:gaussian_intensity} formula.

\section{Effective local potentials}

With \cref{eq:potential_effective} we found an expression of the potential
energy in terms of atomic properties like the dipole transition element and
resonance and the laser intensity distribution. For the laser intensity
distribution of the optical lattice we derived
\cref{eq:gaussian_intensity_approx} and we concluded that the intensity of the
laser used for the creation of local potentials obeys
\cref{eq:gaussian_intensity}. If we add these pieces together we can calculate
the effective potential with local perturbation as seen by the atoms. We will
find that its shape deviates from the idealized local potentials we presented
in the introduction in \Cref{fig:optical_lattice_local_pot} and 
\Cref{fig:optical_lattice_local_barrier}.

\subsubsection{Barrier}

One embodiment of local potentials we described in the introduction was the
barrier potential. A barrier potential confines atoms to a subspace of the
global lattice and could be used to model thermodynamical equilibrium
processes.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{potential/barrier.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.9\textwidth}
  \caption{Local barrier potential and lattice potential in recoil energies.
    The barrier potential is created by targetting two different focus points
    with the perturbation beam (first two rows). If both focus points are
    targetted in a sufficiently short period an average potential (last row)
    can be created.}\label{fig:effective_potential_barrier}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:effective_potential_barrier} the potential energies in terms
of recoil energy are drawn for the barrier potential. To create a two sided
barrier the perturbation beam needs to change between two focus points (first
and second row). If we average over these two focus points we yield the
effective potential (third row).

\subsubsection{Pot}

As a second example of local potentials we named a pot potential that could
draw surrounding atoms.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuredir{potential/pot.pdf}}
  \captionsetup{width=.9\textwidth}
  \caption{Local pot potential and lattice potential in recoil energies. The
    pot potential is created by targetting multiple focus points close to
  each other. Over average this yields a kind of potential
valley.}\label{fig:effective_potential_pot}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:effective_potential_pot} visualized such a potential. In comparison
to the barrier potential more focus points with closer distance are required.
If the focus points change in a sufficient short period an average potential
is felt by the atoms (last row) that resembles a valley.
