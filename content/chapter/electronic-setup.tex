\chapter{Characterisation of the electronic setup}\label{ch:electronic_setup}

\textit{By the time the \gls{rf} signal has reached the acoustic transducer,
it has been synthesized from a reference signal, amplified, and matched to
the impedance of the \gls{aod} transducer. We are going to inspect the
\gls{rf} signal characteristics at each transmission and find that each stage
unintentionally carries out frequency dependent amplitude characteristics
which, as we will see in the next chapter, are responsible for the complex
intensity distribution observed with the photodiode.}

\section{Digital signal synthesizer}

We already covered the fundamental functionality of the \gls{dds} in
\Cref{ch:digital_signal_synthesis} and its integration in our experimental
setup in \Cref{subsec:setup_signal_source}. In this chapter we will discuss
measurements of the frequency and the amplitude characteristics.

Physical analysis of the \gls{dds} output \gls{rf} signal is in fact no simple
endeavour as usual operation time scales are of many magnitudes greater than
the signal periodicity. The procedure we used to resolve this circumstance is
depcited in \Cref{fig:signal_window}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/synthesis/sweep-window.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Idealized \gls{dds} signal output with constant frequency
    increments. The measured window only captures a subset (gray) of the complete
    modulation (shades of blue).}\label{fig:signal_window}
\end{figure}
The strategy consists of capturing multiple, small time windows of the signal
(gray) which delayed would cover the complete signal trace (blue).
\begin{figure}[htb]

  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../figure/signal/setup-dds.pdf}
  \caption{Measurement setup of the synthesizer signal. By inserting a pulse
    generator in between the trigger source and the oscilloscope we can delay
    the capture window of the oscilloscope by the pulse width.
  }\label{fig:signal_window_setup}
\end{figure}
The experimental setup used to reailize this concept is schematically drawn in
\Cref{fig:signal_window_setup}. In between the oscilloscope and the trigger
source we inserted a pulse generator. The pulse generator width equals the
delay time of the oscilloscope and the oscilloscope is configured to capture
on the falling edge of the signal generated by the pulse generator. Further
the oscilloscope's impedance was configured to \SI{50}{\ohm} as high impedance
measurements in the high frequency regime are subject to reflection and
inductance effects. In \Cref{tab:signal_parameters_dds} we can find an
overview of the experimental parameters used.
\begin{table}[htb]

  \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
    \toprule
    Frequency Range $f$ &

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Experimental parameters used to inspect the output \gls{rf} signal
    of the \gls{dds}.
  }\label{tab:signal_parameters_dds}
\end{table}
The specified frequency range is motivated to cover the greatest possible
spatial dimensions permitted by the dimensions of the optics. According to
\cref{eq:spatial_position_frequency} this translates to a spatial resolution
in the atomic plane of about \SI{146}{\micro\meter} (typical atomic clouds are
with \SI{30}{\micro\meter} much smaller). Sweep and window duration were
selected as a compromise between the oscilloscope being able to resolve the
signal fine enough to perform \gls{fft} and the sweep duration being
comparable to later experiments. The time delay was incremented in $N_w$ steps
until $T_s=T_w$, thus we will capture $N_w$ overlapping windows.

\subsubsection{Frequency spectrum}

For an ideal linear frequency sweep we would expect a continuous increase of
the frequency with respect to time, yet we know that the \gls{dds} makes use
of digital signal processing methods which suggests a discrete frequency
spectrum. To help us expose the characteristics of the digital frequency
sweep we will utilize a spectrogram. A spectrogram visualizes how the
frequency spectrum varies in time. One way to obtain a spectrogram is to
partition the data into overlapping time chunks while performing \gls{fft}
which allows us to combine time and frequency domain specific
characteristics. In our case we choose the relative spectral power to be
encoded as color.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \inputpgf{../figure/signal/synthesis}{spectrogram.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Spectrogram of delayed time windows with width
    \SI{100}{\micro\second} of the \gls{dds} output signal configured to
    perform a linear frequency sweep. For an ideal linear sweep we would
    expect a linear timeline of the frequency, instead we observe a discrete
    set of frequencies.
  }\label{fig:signal_synthesis_spectrogram}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:signal_synthesis_spectrogram} depicts four spectrograms, each taken
at a different time window during the frequency sweep. The first spectrogram
captures the start of the frequency sweep as can be read from the time scale.
The first time window does not disclose any signal. This phenomena will be
observed frequently. For unknown reasons the output signal of the \gls{dds} is
absent for multiple microseconds after the \gls{dds} receives the external
trigger signal. The exact duration of the trigger delay varies around
\SI{4}{\milli\second} but does not affect the internal state of the \gls{dds}
as the first measured frequency matches the theoretically expected frequency
according to the ramp. If we take a look at the following spectrogram windows
we can see how the \gls{dds} outputs a constant frequency over a short time
period (\SI{100}{\micro\second}), therefore the frequency range consists of
discrete frequencies. We can actually even observe such a
frequency increment in the second, third and fifth spectrogram. Finally in the
last spectrogram the frequency drops back to the initial value --- a side
effect of the \gls{dds} sweep mode which unfortunately is the only mode, that
supports an external trigger signal.

  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \inputpgf{../figure/signal/synthesis}{frequency.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Most dominant frequency in the \gls{fft} spectrum for each
    (delayed) measurement during a frequency sweep of the \gls{dds}.
  }\label{fig:signal_synthesis_frequency}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{ch:digital_signal_synthesis} we were unable to make a statement about
the frequency resolution of the digital ramp. Therefore we visualized the
frequency evolution with each delayed measurement in
\Cref{fig:signal_synthesis_frequency}. Neglecting the first \num{50}
measurements because of the trigger hole, we find that on average the
frequency increments by about \SI{310}{\kilo\hertz}. Using
\cref{eq:spatial_position_frequency} this relates to a spatial resolution of
about \SI{1.1}{\micro\meter}.

\subsubsection{Amplitude frequency response}

In the Fourier space we can locate the dominant frequency at the maximum of
the power spectrum. That in mind we can reduce the previous obtained time
window measurements to pairs of dominant frequencies and maximum amplitude.
Under the assumption that the maximum voltage per measurement is approximately
the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the signal we can find the amplitude
frequency response spectrum with little effort.
\Cref{fig:signal_synthesis_response} visualizes the described routine for the
\gls{dds} assigned to the \gls{h} and \gls{v} \gls{aod} with frequency control
by digital ramp and manual increments.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/synthesis/response.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Amplitude frequency response of the \gls{dds} signal sources for
    the \gls{h} and \gls{v} \gls{aod}. The frequency increments
    are performed through the integrated digital ramp and manually.
  }\label{fig:signal_synthesis_response}
\end{figure}
The peak-to-peak amplitude of the synthesizser signal is constant with small
noise contributions. On a closer view we can see that the oscilloscopes
voltage resolution is at its limit, thus we only observe discrete voltage
steps. We conclude from \Cref{fig:signal_synthesis_response} that the
amplitude response of the \gls{dds} is independent of the output frequency
and the method used to provide frequency increments. The sinc response
we theorized to cause a drop of about \SI{2}{\percent} of the amplitude in
\Cref{ch:digital_signal_synthesis} is not observable in our measurements.

\section{Power amplifier}

The piezoelectric attached to the acousto-optic crystal inside the \gls{aod}
elements has to emit acoustic waves strong enough to propagate through the
crystal of the \gls{aod}. The power demands specified by the \gls{aod} are
not met by the \gls{dds}, therefore we have to employ a power amplifier
between the \gls{dds} and the \gls{aod}. Even though we previously concluded
that the \gls{dds} signal amplitude is independent of the output frequency,
the power amplifier can introduce new frequency dependent characteristics
which we dedicate ourselves to in this section.

\subsubsection{Amplitude frequency response}\label{subsec:electronic_amplitude_frequency_response}

The measurement procedure described in the previous section is still valid
for the now amplified signal of strength \SI{33}{\decibelm}. At the
usual \SI{50}{\ohm} in between coaxial cables this corresponds to an
approximate voltage of \SI{10}{\volt}. In order to protect the oscilloscope
against potential damage caused by too much power, we inserted a chain of
attentuators (order given from coaxial cable to oscilloscope):
\SI{1}{\decibel} -- \SI{3}{\decibel} -- \SI{3}{\decibel} -- \SI{6}{\decibel}
-- \SI{10}{\decibel} -- \SI{10}{\decibel}. The order was chosen in such a way
to distribute heat uniformly accross the attentuators. The total
damping of this configuration yields \SI{33}{\decibel} which should give us
the same signal power as before from the \gls{dds}.
\Cref{fig:signal_amplification_response} presents the damped output signal
after amplification for the two distinct (\gls{h}, \gls{v}) amplifiers and
\gls{dds} signals for the same input frequencies as in the previous
measurement.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/amplification/response.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Amplitude frequency response of the \gls{dds} signal after power
    amplification. In comparison to the \gls{dds} we observe very small
    oscillations.
  }\label{fig:signal_amplification_response}
\end{figure}
In comparison to the \gls{dds} response the amplifier introduces small ripple.
Again, we cannot identify significant differences between the type of
frequency increment used. Although these effects are small in terms of voltage it is
difficult to relate them to the overall power response as only voltage but
not current was measured.

\subsubsection{Network analyzer transmission}

We previously discovered that the amplifier amends the frequency amplitude
response, nevertheless it is difficult to isolate the actual influence of
the amplifier. Therefore we conducted more detailed measurements of the
amplifiers power transmission with the network analyzer. The network analyzer
is a device that can measure reflection and transmission parameters of
electric components. As it was exactly built for these types of measurements,
we expect it to have more significance, then the previous measurement. As in
the measurement with the oscilloscope we also haveto protect the network
analyzer against the output power of the amplifier. This time we used a
single \SI{30}{\decibel} attentuator in between the network analyzer input
and the power amplifier output.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/amplification/transmission.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Frequency transmission spectrum obtained via the network analyzer
    of the horziontal and vertical amplifiers.
  }\label{fig:signal_amplification_spectrum}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:signal_amplification_spectrum} we see the frequency transmission
spectrum obtained through the network analyzer connected to the horizontal
and vertical amplifiers. We can confirm an offset of the amplification
gain between both amplifiers. If we assume a power amplification
difference of $L=\SI{.2}{\decibel}$, i.e.\ between \SI{80}{\mega\hertz} and
\SI{115}{\mega\hertz} with the \gls{v} amplifier, according to
\begin{equation}
  P
  =
  P_0 10^{L/\SI{10}{\decibel}}
  \label{eq:power_gain_decibel},
\end{equation}
and $P_0=\SI{2}{\watt}$ we would have to expect a drop of up to
\SI{.05}{\watt} in power. Unfortunately we cannot say in how far this is
a relevant magnitude for the \gls{aod}.

\section{Acoustic transducer}

In the previous sections we explored the signal transfer of the synthesis
and amplification stage. The last stage that is accessable to us concerns the
power reflection at the \gls{aod} itself. From the reflection we may estimate
power transmission characteristics, hence for a large reflection we would
expect a small transmission and in that sense less beam intensity in the first
diffraction order.

\subsection{Reflection spectrum}

The power reflection measurements were conducted with the network analyzer
which we have introduced in the previous section. In a first embodiment of the
experiment we directly supplied the \gls{aod} through a coaxial cable of the
network analyzer with power and measured the reflection. In a second
embodiment we used a directional coupler to supply the respective amplifier
with a signal and measure the reflection through a directional coupler.

\subsubsection{Direct connection}

\Cref{fig:signal_reflection_direct} visualizes the power reflection spectrum
of both \gls{aod} elements when directly connected to the network analyzer at
a maximum output power of \SI{10}{\decibel\meter}. The network analyzer port
supplies the signal and measures its reflection.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/reflection/direct.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Signal reflection of the two different \gls{aod} when directly
    connected to the network analyzer.
  }\label{fig:signal_reflection_direct}
\end{figure}
The most interesting finding in \Cref{fig:signal_reflection_direct} is that
the power reflection shows very different behaviour for the distinct \gls{aod}
elements. The \gls{aod} anticipated for the vertical deflection is most
transmissive at \SI{97}{\mega\hertz} with transmission falling of on both
sides while the \gls{aod} anticipated for the horizontal deflection has two
local transmission maxima and a rather bad transmision near the center
frequency.

\subsubsection{Amplified coupled connection}

In the second procedure we amplify the signal and couple the network analyzer
through a directional coupler to measure the refleciton. This is done in order
to avoid harm to the network analyzer as the network analyzer is not able to
handle \SI{2}{\watt} signals. The direct-coupler is an apparatus comprising a
coaxial input and output port as well as a coaxial input reflection and output
reflection port. It is disignated to measure the reflection of a (possible)
high power signal without jeopardizing measurement equipement.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/reflection/coupled.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Reflection at the direct-coupler output after amplification of the
    network analyzer input signal for different amplifications with reference
    to \SI{1}{\milli\watt}. We see that the applied power does not affect the
    spectrum.
  }\label{fig:signal_reflection_coupled}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:signal_reflection_coupler} we see the reflection spectrum for
the case that we provide the network analyzer output signal to the input of
the directional coupler and connect the reflection output of the directional
coupler with the second network analyzer port while the remaining ports are
under \SI{50}{\ohm} closure. We note that the reflection measured through the
directional coupler is lowered by many orders of magnitude compared to the
input signal but essentially of the same shape. The noise in the reflection is
very high because of the low power supplied into the directional coupler. We
now use the directional coupler to measure the output reflection at the
\gls{aod} elements after the signal was amplified.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../figure/signal/setup-transducer.pdf}
  \caption{Experimental setup to measure the reflection at the acousto-optic
    transducer. The network analyzer supplies an input signal to the

    coupler allows to safely measure input and output reflection.
  }\label{fig:signal_amplification_transducer_setup}
\end{figure}
The setup is depicted in \Cref{fig:signal_amplification_transducer_setup}.
The network analyzer on the left-hand side supplies an input signal to the
amplifier. The input signal changes linear in frequency. The output signal
of the amplifier is connected through a directional coupler with the
acousto-optic element. The directional coupler allows to measure input and
output reflection.

    of the directional coupler while other ports are closed with

  }\label{fig:signal_reflection_coupler}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:signal_reflection_coupled} we see the effective reflection
spectrum for the distinct \gls{aod} elements. The effective reflection
spectrum is obtained when subtracting the input reflection from the output
reflection.

\subsubsection{Comparison}

In the previous part we saw that the reflection spectrum does not show any
power dependence, thus we should be able to compare the spectrum we obtained
directly with the amplified result.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{width=\textwidth}
    \input{../figure/signal/reflection/comparison.pgf}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption{Reflection from amplified input signal and direct signal as well as
    transmission spectrum from the amplifier. We can see that the better
    amplification left of \SI{90}{\mega\hertz} slightly changes the reflection
    spectrum of the \gls{aod}.
  }\label{fig:signal_reflection_comparison}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:signal_reflection_comparison} we can see how there is additional
reflection from the amplifier, nevertheless the global characteristics remain
the same.

\subsubsection{Summary}

Distinct \gls{aod} elements show different power transmission characteristics
independent of the applied power. A detailed examination of the \gls{aod}
elements discloses different impedance matching circuits. Impedance matching
is used to reduce power reflection by providing a constant input resistance
of \SI{50}{\ohm} accross a wide frequency range. Still the impedance
differs between the \gls{aod}s. We assume that the crystal properties,
i.e.\ cutting angle or purity, are responsible for that. This is supported by
the fact that the impedance matching circuits differ between the \gls{aod}
elements.
