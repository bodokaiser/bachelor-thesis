\chapter{Introduction}

Complex quantum systems studied in condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry
as well as high-energy physics are not always accessable in a manner as
required by research. Experiments involving ultracold atoms in optical
lattices allow the study of many body quantum systems in a controllable
environment, giving us the opportunity to simulate and explore quantum
effects and expand our current understanding of quantum mechanics and
statistical physics \cite{Gross2017}.

The central idea behind these types of experiments is to cool down neutral
atoms to (below) micro Kelvin and load them into an optical lattice. At these
low temperatures the atoms demonstrate quantum behaviour. The optical lattices
act as periodic potentials analogue to the periodic potential inside crystal
lattices as known from solid state physics \cite{Lewenstein2007}.
