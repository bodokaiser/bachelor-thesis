\chapter{Introduction}

Complex quantum systems studied in condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry
as well as high-energy physics are not always accessable enough as required
by research. Experiments involving ultracold atoms allow the study of many
body quantum systems in a controllable environment giving us the opportunity
to simulate quantum effects of said systems and further understand the quantum
and statistical physics guiding our daily life \cite{Gross2017}.
