\chapter{Measurement}

With the previously described experimental setup we conducted various
measurements. We can classifier these measurements into two sets: The first
class includes measurements for calibration, the second measurements with the
intent to prove concepts and benchmark the results.

\section{Calibration}

Alterations inside the laboratory together with the exchange of components
from the original setup made it necessary to recalibrate the optics.

\subsection{Fiber Coupling}

The visually shielded section of the setup used to reduce the output power
of the laser source is optically paired with the open section for beam
deflection via a \gls{smf}. Through tuning the polarisator inside the power
reduction section we can try to match one of the orthogonal polarization
modes supported by the \gls{smf}. A polarization discrepancy induces the
polarization inside the \gls{smf} to oscillate on environmental changes like
temperature, thus we tried to minimize these effects by observing intensity
changes detected by a photodiode behind a beam splitter through an
oscilloscope.
