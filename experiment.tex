\chapter{Experimental Setup}

The exerimental setup was largely adopted from \cite{Hertlein2017}. Major
amendments made, affect the radio frequency signal source of the \gls{aod}.
Further we installed an additional beam splitter and photodiode to measure
intensity drifts caused by different deflection angles.
